  - On the first floor, you will find three stone statues. They stand close to me.
    Start there.
  - "On the second floor, there are four statues, one in each corner. Listen carefully
    \u2014 the echoes are stronger there."
  - The third floor is deeper. There you will find five tombs. The oldest songs sleep
    inside them. Be respectful.
